# Vuetify Loader for Meteor
This Meteor package loads the Vuetify components as you use them (TreeShaking), reducing the final bundle size and enhancing your RealTime App performance, also bringing a better development experience.

Vuetify's A La Carte System and sass-loader based on dart-sass can work now in Meteor without replacing Meteor's default Bundler with Webpack.

## Idea 
1. Since Vuetify's A La Carte System is tightly bounded to Webpack bundler, if you want to use this UI framework in a serious project, you'll need to remove Meteor's default bundler and compiler and replace it with Webpack Bundler, probably using @ardatan 's meteor-webpack package. But this change will impact the way you develop in Meteor (especially in Mobile) in such a way, that we all need a different approach, based on Meteor's own Bundler.
2. meteor-webpack is a "good" choice if you are an expert configuring webpack and babel and have time to experiment with them, but its a terrible choice for beginners or for rapid development, or Cordova Integration (Meteor+Webpack breaks HMR on Cordova).
3. fourseven:scss (the default meteor sass-loader) uses node-sass (a deprecated sass compiler), and will not work properly with Vuetify's Sass files. So we need to create a SCSS/SASS compiler using dart-sass (sass npm package).
4. The .vue Single File Components Compiler, must recognize  any vuetify component inside the template tag, and must import it's module , config and styles on the fly...
5. I know there are a lot of developers in search of a decent Meteor-Vuetify integration Â¿Are we able to develop a Vuetify-Loader package with A la Carte System and TreeShaking working in Meteor Framework? Lets see... 

## Credits
* [@akryum](https://github.com/Akryum) of course. thanks for all the effort bringing vue to Meteor.
* [@fourseven:scss](https://github.com/Meteor-Community-Packages/meteor-scss), i've tweaked your package a little bit to replace node-sass with dart-sass. Thanks!!
* [@johnleider](https://github.com/johnleider) We all love Vuetify!!

## Warning
This package is in an early development stage, use it at your own risk.

If you find any problem with it, dont hesitate to improve it and make a PR, or submit an issue.

If it works for you, great!!, enjoy...

## Installation

1. Add akryum vue-component package if you havent already: 
   
   `meteor add akryum:vue-component`
2. Remove fourseven:scss if you have it: 
   
   `meteor remove fourseven:scss`
3. Add this package:
   
   `meteor add zer0th:meteor-vuetify-loader`
4. Make sure you are importing vuetify/lib instead of vuetify

```javascript
  import Vue from 'vue'

  import Vuetify from 'vuetify/lib' // <-The magic goes here

  Vue.use(Vuetify)

  const opts = {}
  export default new Vuetify(opts)
```
5. **Important !!!**: In order to load Vuetify Components on the fly in your .vue, you must add a "lang" attribute to the 'script' tag. for instance:
```html
  <template>
    <v-button> <!-- The VButton component will be loaded on the fly-->   
      Anything
    </v-button>    
  <template>    
  <script lang="vuetify"> //  <--- the magic goes here
    export default {
      name:"ComponentName",
      data: ()=>({
        someData: ""
      })
    }
  </script>
```
6. Enjoy!!... Or improve it!!

But this change will impact the way you develop in Meteor (especially in Mobile) in such a way, that we need a different approach.
2. Meteor with Webpack is a good choice if you are an expert configuring webpack and babel and have time to experiment, but its a terrible choice for beginners or for rapid development.
3. fourseven:scss uses node-sass (a deprecated sass compiler), and will not work properly with Vuetify Sass files. So we need to create a SCSS compiler using dart-sass (similar to sass-loader).
4. .vue Single Component Files, must be compiled in such way, that if they find a vuetify component inside the template tag, they must load and import it's module, config and styles.
